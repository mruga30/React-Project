        <h1>Welcome to my Blog!</h1>
        <p> This blog presents my ideas of a new education system and lifestyle that I think should be 
        adopted because our current lifestyle is just going to hurt us and is harming the environment.
        </p>
        <p>
        Education is a very important part of of every person's life and I think it is important that
        right kind of education be provided. There are many examples in today's education system 
        (at least in India) that are not adding to a student's growth and here I present some of my ideas
        of change that need to be implemented to improve the system.
        </p>
        <p>
        Our lifestyles too need to change in many ways. In today's world, where most of us have grown
        to develop a capitalist mindset, our lifestyles have been affected big time and people have 
        neglected the basic things that can provide true happiness and true meaning of life which 
        has in turn affected overall mental health of people. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Thus, with each blog post, I tried to present some simple, well-known techniques that we should
        start paying attention to and also start incorporating them into our lives diligently. Just before
        you leave this page thinking that it is going to be the same as every other health blog post then
        please stick around for one/two articles and decide for yourself. I try here to provide solutions
        in a manner that will give you ways to incorporate these in your life. 
        </p>
