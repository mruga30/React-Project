        <p>
            My name is Mruga. I have created this blog on my own from scratch to demonstrate what 
            I preach in my articles. I am advocator of better education and lifestyle changes of
            the millenial generation and thus my blog is all about what I think needs changes and 
            how you can make a positive difference in your life by incorporating some of those ideas
            into your life. I do not want to force my ideas onto anyone but would like you to give it
            a chance and read for yourself whether it suits you.
